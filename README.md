Predicting Titanic Survival: An End-to-End Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project





Overview
This project tackles the classic Kaggle "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" challenge. The goal is to build a predictive model that answers a crucial question: what factors determined whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic? This end-to-end analysis demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data, perform insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineer meaningful features, and implement machine learning algorithms to solve a binary classification problem. By leveraging Python and key data science libraries, I aimed to not just build a model, but also to understand the underlying patterns in the data that contributed to survival.

Key Objectives
Comprehensive Data Exploration: Uncover key trends and relationships within the Titanic passenger data using various visualization techniques.
Strategic Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and transform categorical features to prepare the data for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering for Insight: Create new features that potentially enhance the predictive power of the models.
Rigorous Model Building & Evaluation: Implement and compare multiple machine learning classifiers, evaluating their performance using appropriate metrics and cross-validation to ensure robust generalization.
Clear and Actionable Insights: Communicate the key factors influencing survival in a clear and understandable manner.
Project Highlights
In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Revealed significant correlations between survival rate and factors like passenger class, gender, and age. For instance, first-class passengers had a ~63% higher survival rate compared to third-class passengers, and the survival rate for females was ~74% higher than for males. Visualizations illustrating these trends can be found within the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.
Effective Data Cleaning: Successfully handled missing age values by employing median imputation stratified by passenger class, a more nuanced approach than simple mean imputation. Missing 'Embarked' values were imputed using the mode. Categorical features like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' were transformed using one-hot encoding to be compatible with machine learning algorithms.
Feature Engineering for Predictive Power: Engineered the "FamilySize" feature by combining the number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard, providing a potentially more informative predictor than individual family member counts. Additionally, created an "IsAlone" feature to identify passengers traveling without family.
Robust Model Evaluation: Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, utilizing 5-fold cross-validation to obtain a reliable estimate of each model's performance on unseen data. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the best performance, with a top validation accuracy of 82.5% and an F1-score of 77.8%.
Actionable Insights: The analysis underscores the significant impact of socio-economic status (passenger class), gender, and family size on survival probabilities during the Titanic disaster.
Code and Libraries
This project was implemented using Python and the following key libraries:

Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating informative and visually appealing data visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing and evaluating machine learning models.
The complete code, including detailed comments and explanations, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

Key Findings
Based on our analysis and the best performing model, the key factors that significantly influenced a passenger's survival on the Titanic were:

Passenger Class: Higher class passengers had a significantly higher chance of survival, indicating socio-economic privilege played a critical role.
Gender: Females had a remarkably higher survival rate than males, likely due to the "women and children first" protocol.
Age: Children (especially young ones) generally had a higher survival rate than adults, while very old passengers also saw varying rates.
Family Size: Passengers traveling with small families (2-4 members) often had a slightly higher chance of survival compared to those traveling alone or in very large groups.
Next Steps and Potential Improvements
Further hyperparameter tuning of the top-performing model to potentially increase its accuracy and robustness.
Exploring more advanced feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction features between existing variables (e.g., Age and Class).
Investigating other machine learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM) or even basic Deep Learning models, to see if they can yield better results.
Deploying the trained model using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit to create an interactive prediction interface.
